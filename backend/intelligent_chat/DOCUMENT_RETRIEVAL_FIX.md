# Document Retrieval Fix - "Images I Shared" Issue

## Problem

When users asked for "images I shared" or "documents I uploaded" later in a conversation, the chatbot would only return 2-4 images based on semantic similarity, not ALL the images they had previously uploaded to that conversation.

### Root Cause

The system was relying solely on **semantic search** from Pinecone, which returns only the most semantically similar documents to the current query. When a user says "send me more images", the semantic search algorithm doesn't understand they want ALL previously uploaded images - it just finds the ones most similar to that phrase.

### Example from Logs

```
Line 114: ‚úÖ Retrieved 4 matches from namespace 'user_248_docs'  ‚úÖ
Line 296: ‚úÖ Retrieved 2 matches from namespace 'user_248_docs'  ‚ùå Only 2!
```

## Solution

### 1. **Detect Reference Queries**

Added detection for when users explicitly reference previously shared items:

```python
# Detect if asking for "images/documents I shared" - indicating they want ALL previous items
reference_keywords = ['i shared', 'i uploaded', 'i sent', 'i gave', 'that i', 'i provided']
is_reference_query = any(keyword in query_lower for keyword in reference_keywords) and is_image_query
```

### 2. **Retrieve ALL Documents from Conversation History**

When a reference query is detected, the system now queries the database directly to get ALL documents attached to messages in that conversation:

```python
if is_reference_query and conversation_id:
    logger.info(f"üîç User asking for previously shared items - retrieving ALL from conversation {conversation_id}")
    
    # Query ic_message_documents to get ALL documents from this conversation
    result = await session.execute(
        text("""
            SELECT DISTINCT d.id, d.filename, d.file_type, d.s3_url, 
                   d.extracted_text, d.created_at
            FROM ic_documents d
            JOIN ic_message_documents md ON d.id = md.document_id
            JOIN ic_messages m ON md.message_id = m.id
            WHERE m.conversation_id = :conversation_id
              AND m.user_id = :user_id
            ORDER BY d.created_at DESC
        """),
        {"conversation_id": conversation_id, "user_id": user_id}
    )
```

### 3. **Pass conversation_id Through the Call Stack**

Updated method signatures to pass `conversation_id` from the API route all the way down to the memory retrieval:

```
API Route (chat.py)
  ‚Üì
ChatService._build_context()
  ‚Üì
ChatService._retrieve_memories()
  ‚Üì
MemoryService.retrieve_memories()
  ‚Üì
MemoryService._retrieve_general_memories(conversation_id)
  ‚Üì
Database query for ALL conversation documents
```

## Files Modified

1. **`services/memory_service.py`**
   - Added `conversation_id` parameter to `retrieve_memories()` and `_retrieve_general_memories()`
   - Added reference query detection logic
   - Added database query to retrieve ALL documents from conversation history

2. **`services/chat_service.py`**
   - Updated `_build_context()` to pass `conversation_id` to `retrieve_memories()`

3. **`services/base_chat_service.py`**
   - Updated `_build_context()` and `_retrieve_memories()` to accept and pass `conversation_id`

4. **`services/health_chat_service.py`**
   - Updated `_retrieve_memories()` signature to accept `conversation_id`

5. **`services/wayofdog_chat_service.py`**
   - Updated `_retrieve_memories()` signature to accept `conversation_id`

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: User uploads 4 images and immediately asks about them
- **Before**: Semantic search returns 4 images ‚úÖ
- **After**: Same behavior ‚úÖ

### Scenario 2: User asks "send me more images I shared" later
- **Before**: Semantic search returns only 2-4 most similar images ‚ùå
- **After**: System detects reference query ‚Üí Queries database ‚Üí Returns ALL 4 images ‚úÖ

### Scenario 3: User asks general question about documents
- **Before**: Semantic search returns relevant documents ‚úÖ
- **After**: Same behavior (semantic search still used for non-reference queries) ‚úÖ

## Testing

To test this fix:

1. Upload 4-5 images to a conversation
2. Have a few back-and-forth messages
3. Ask: "Can you show me all the images I shared with you?"
4. **Expected**: All uploaded images should be returned, not just 2-3

## Trigger Phrases

The system now recognizes these phrases as "reference queries":
- "images I shared"
- "documents I uploaded"
- "photos I sent"
- "files I gave you"
- "pictures that I provided"

## Benefits

‚úÖ Users can now reliably retrieve ALL previously uploaded documents
‚úÖ Semantic search still works for general queries
‚úÖ No performance impact (database query only runs for reference queries)
‚úÖ Works across all chat modes (General, Health, Way of Dog)

## Notes

- The fix only applies to **General Mode** currently (where `active_mode=None`)
- Health and Way of Dog modes already have their own specialized retrieval logic
- The database query is efficient (uses JOINs and indexes)
- Documents are still filtered by file type if the query specifically asks for images
