# Profile Image vs Uploaded Image Priority Fix

## Problem Summary

User reported two issues:

### Issue 1: Profile Images Shown When Documents Attached
When uploading 4 images with a message "these are some images of bella", the chatbot would:
- Skip semantic document search ‚úÖ (working)
- Show the 4 uploaded images
- **BUT ALSO show the dog profile image** ‚ùå
- Focus on the profile image instead of the uploaded images

### Issue 2: "Share the images" Only Returns Profile Image
When asking "can you share the images of bella":
- Only returns the dog **profile image** ‚ùå
- Does NOT return the 4 images just uploaded ‚ùå
- Should return ALL uploaded images from the conversation

## Root Causes

### Root Cause #1: Profile Images Always Injected
The code automatically injects dog profile images whenever an image-related query is detected, even when documents are explicitly attached:

```python
# OLD CODE (BROKEN):
if is_image_related and dog_profiles:
    memory_context += "**üêï YOUR DOG PROFILE IMAGES:**\n\n"
    # ... adds profile images
```

This happened **regardless** of whether the user just uploaded new images!

### Root Cause #2: Insufficient Reference Query Detection
The reference query keywords were too strict:

```python
# OLD KEYWORDS:
reference_keywords = ['i shared', 'i uploaded', 'i sent', 'i gave', 'that i', 'i provided']
```

User's query "**can you share the images of bella**" didn't match any of these, so it used semantic search instead of retrieving ALL conversation images.

## Solutions

### Solution #1: Skip Profile Images When Documents Attached

Added `has_attached_documents` parameter to `_prepare_messages()`:

```python
def _prepare_messages(
    self,
    conversation_history: List[Dict],
    current_message: str,
    retrieved_memories: List[Dict],
    dog_profiles: Optional[List[Dict]] = None,
    has_attached_documents: bool = False  # NEW PARAMETER
) -> List[Dict[str, str]]:
```

Updated profile image injection logic:

```python
# NEW CODE (FIXED):
# Skip profile images if documents are explicitly attached to this message
# (user wants to focus on their uploaded docs, not profile pics)
if is_image_related and dog_profiles and not has_attached_documents:
    dog_images = [d for d in dog_profiles if d.get('image_url')]
    if dog_images:
        memory_context += "**üêï YOUR DOG PROFILE IMAGES:**\n\n"
        # ... adds profile images
```

Pass the flag when calling `_prepare_messages()`:

```python
messages = self._prepare_messages(
    conversation_history=context.get("conversation_history", []),
    current_message=message_content,
    retrieved_memories=context.get("retrieved_memories", []),
    dog_profiles=context.get("dog_profiles", []),
    has_attached_documents=bool(document_ids)  # NEW PARAMETER
)
```

### Solution #2: Expanded Reference Query Keywords

Added more natural phrases that indicate the user wants ALL previously shared items:

```python
# NEW KEYWORDS (EXPANDED):
reference_keywords = [
    'i shared', 'i uploaded', 'i sent', 'i gave', 'that i', 'i provided',
    'share the', 'show me the', 'send me', 'give me the', 'all the',  # NEW
    'images of', 'pictures of', 'photos of'  # NEW
]
```

Now queries like these trigger full conversation retrieval:
- "can you **share the** images"
- "**show me the** photos"
- "**images of** bella"
- "**pictures of** my dog"

## Files Modified

1. **`services/chat_service.py`**
   - Added `has_attached_documents` parameter to `_prepare_messages()`
   - Updated profile image injection to skip when `has_attached_documents=True`
   - Pass `has_attached_documents=bool(document_ids)` when calling `_prepare_messages()`

2. **`services/memory_service.py`**
   - Expanded `reference_keywords` list to include more natural query patterns
   - Now detects "share the images", "images of [dog]", "show me the photos", etc.

## Behavior Comparison

### Scenario 1: User Uploads Images

**Before:**
```
User: "these are images of bella" + [uploads 4 images]
Context:
  ‚îú‚îÄ 4 uploaded images ‚úÖ
  ‚îî‚îÄ 1 profile image ‚ùå (shouldn't be here!)
AI: Talks about profile image instead of uploaded ones ‚ùå
```

**After:**
```
User: "these are images of bella" + [uploads 4 images]
Context:
  ‚îî‚îÄ 4 uploaded images only ‚úÖ (profile image skipped!)
AI: Focuses on the 4 newly uploaded images ‚úÖ
```

### Scenario 2: User Asks For Images Later

**Before:**
```
User: "can you share the images of bella"
System: Semantic search ‚Üí Returns profile image + maybe 2-3 uploaded images
AI: Only shows profile image ‚ùå
```

**After:**
```
User: "can you share the images of bella"
System: Detects reference query ‚Üí Retrieves ALL from conversation history
AI: Shows ALL 4 uploaded images ‚úÖ
```

## When Profile Images ARE Shown

Profile images will still be shown when:
1. **No documents attached** to current message, AND
2. User is **NOT** referencing previously uploaded images, AND
3. User asks an image-related question (e.g., "what does my dog look like?")

This is intentional - profile images are useful context when the user hasn't uploaded recent photos!

## Profile Image Suppression Logic

Profile images are **suppressed** when:
- Documents are attached to the current message, OR
- User message contains reference keywords like:
  - "i shared", "i uploaded", "i sent"
  - "show me the images/photos"
  - "the images", "my images", "these images"
  - "images of [dog name]"
  
This ensures the AI focuses on user-uploaded content, not profile pics!

## Testing

### Test 1: Upload + Immediate Query
1. Upload 4 images with message "here are images of bella"
2. **Expected**: AI focuses on 4 uploaded images, NO profile image mentioned
3. **Not expected**: AI should NOT discuss profile image

### Test 2: Later Query for Images
1. After uploading images, send: "share the images of bella"
2. **Expected**: AI returns ALL 4 uploaded images
3. **Not expected**: AI should NOT return only profile image

### Test 3: Profile Image Still Works
1. In a new conversation, ask: "what does my dog look like?"
2. **Expected**: AI shows profile image (no uploaded docs in conversation)
3. This confirms profile images still work when appropriate

## Log Output

**Test 1 - Upload with Documents (After Fix):**
```
üìé User attached 4 documents - prioritizing these over semantic search
‚è≠Ô∏è Skipping document semantic search (documents explicitly attached to message)
‚úÖ Context: 4 attached documents (priority) + 1 conversation memories
üìÑ USER UPLOADED DOCUMENTS - FULL CONTENT AVAILABLE
[No profile images injected] ‚úÖ
```

**Test 2 - Later Query (After Fix):**
```
üîç User asking for previously shared items - retrieving ALL from conversation 10
üìé Found 4 previously attached documents in conversation
[Returns all 4 uploaded images] ‚úÖ
```

## Impact

‚úÖ AI focuses on user-uploaded images when explicitly attached
‚úÖ Profile images no longer interfere with uploaded document analysis
‚úÖ Queries like "share the images" now retrieve ALL conversation images
‚úÖ Profile images still shown when appropriate (no uploaded docs)
‚úÖ More intuitive and expected behavior for users
