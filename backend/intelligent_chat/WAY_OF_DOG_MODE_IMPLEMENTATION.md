## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### **Service Layer**
```
WayOfDogChatService (wayofdog_chat_service.py)
    ↓ extends
BaseChatService (base_chat_service.py)
    ↓ uses
MemoryService (memory_service.py)
    ↓ queries
Pinecone (user_{user_id}_book_notes, book-content-{env}, conversations-{env})
```

### **Routing Flow**
```
User sends message with active_mode="wayofdog"
    ↓
POST /api/v2/stream (chat.py)
    ↓
get_service_for_mode("wayofdog")
    ↓
wayofdog_service.process_message()
    ↓
_retrieve_book_memories() → Queries 3 Pinecone namespaces
    ↓
_format_user_book_notes() → Formats for AI context
    ↓
Claude AI (with philosophical system prompt)
    ↓
Streams response to frontend
```

### **Memory Retrieval Strategy**

#### Priority Weighting:
| Source | Namespace | Priority Boost | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| User's Book Notes | `user_{user_id}_book_notes` | 3.0x | Their spiritual journey markers |
| Book Content | `book-content-{environment}` | 2.0x | Source wisdom |
| Conversations | `intelligent-chat-conversations-{environment}` | 1.0x | Contextual background |

#### Retrieval Process:
1. Generate query embedding
2. Query all 3 namespaces in parallel
3. Apply priority boost to results
4. Re-rank using Anthropic's contextual retrieval
5. Return top N results (configurable via `WAYOFDOG_MODE_TOP_K`)

## 🎨 System Prompt Highlights

### **Core Instructions**
- No roleplay actions (`*smiles*`, etc.)
- Use emojis naturally for warmth (📖 ✨ 🌟 💭)
- Ask 2-3 thought-provoking questions per response
- Reference user's notes specifically
- Connect book wisdom to personal experiences
- Short insights + frequent questions = spiritual connection

### **Response Structure**
```
1. Acknowledge (1-2 sentences)
   - Recognize what they're asking/sharing
   
2. Reflect (2-3 sentences)
   - Connect to their book notes
   - Quote book passages
   - Draw connections

3. Illuminate (Main body)
   - Provide wisdom and insights
   - Use metaphors
   - Reference specific teachings

4. Invite (Questions)
   - 2-3 thought-provoking questions
   - Encourage deeper reflection
```

### **Example Philosophical Response**
```
That frustration you feel when your dog pulls on the leash - I see in your notes 
from page 34 that you highlighted: "The leash is not a tool of control, but a 
thread of connection." ✨

What if your dog's pulling isn't defiance, but an invitation? An invitation to 
see your own need for control, your own impatience, your own resistance to the 
present moment.

The book teaches us that dogs are mirrors. When we pull against them, we pull 
against ourselves. When we soften, when we walk together with patience - both 
become free. 🐕

I'm curious:
- What does this pulling reveal about where you're pulling in your own life?
- When have you felt most connected to your dog - was it when you were in 
  control, or when you surrendered?
- What would it mean to see the leash walk as a meditation rather than a task?

This journey isn't about fixing your dog. It's about discovering who you become 
through this relationship. What does that stir in you? 💭

## 📊 Configuration

### **Settings** (`config/settings.py`)
```python
WAYOFDOG_MODE_TOP_K: int = 8  # Number of memories to retrieve
```
