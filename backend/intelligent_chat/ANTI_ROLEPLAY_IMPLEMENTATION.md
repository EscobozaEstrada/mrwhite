# Anti-Roleplay Expression Implementation

## Problem
The AI was generating roleplay actions and stage directions like:
- `*smiles warmly*`
- `*leans in slightly*`
- `*eyes sparkling with curiosity*`
- `smiles warmly` (without asterisks)

These expressions are undesirable and create an unprofessional, character-acting experience instead of a natural conversation.

## Solution: Multi-Layer Defense System

### **Layer 1: Aggressive System Prompt Instructions**
**Location:** 
- `/backend/intelligent_chat/services/base_chat_service.py` (lines 368-390)
- `/backend/intelligent_chat/services/wayofdog_chat_service.py` (lines 72-92)

**Implementation:**
```python
🔥 **CRITICAL RULES - VIOLATING THESE WILL FAIL THE RESPONSE:**

**🚫 RULE #1: ABSOLUTELY NO ROLEPLAY ACTIONS OR STAGE DIRECTIONS**
FORBIDDEN EXAMPLES (NEVER DO THIS):
❌ "*smiles warmly*"
❌ "*leans in slightly*"
❌ "*chuckles*"
❌ "*eyes sparkling with curiosity*"
❌ "smiles warmly" (without asterisks)
❌ ANY text describing physical actions, facial expressions, or gestures

**✅ CORRECT ALTERNATIVES:**
Instead of "*smiles warmly*" → Just write naturally: "Hello! 😊"
Instead of "*chuckles*" → Use emoji: "Haha 😄"
Instead of "*nods*" → Say: "Yes, I understand"

**WHY THIS MATTERS:** You are a text-based AI assistant, not a character in a story.
```

**Coverage:**
- ✅ General Mode (via `BaseChatService`)
- ✅ Health Mode (inherits from `BaseChatService`)
- ✅ Way of Dog Mode (has its own enhanced version)

### **Layer 2: Real-Time Streaming Filter**
**Location:** `/backend/intelligent_chat/services/base_chat_service.py` (lines 845-857)

**Implementation:**
```python
buffer = ""  # Buffer to detect and filter roleplay patterns

async for chunk in stream:
    token_content = chunk_data.get("content", "")
    buffer += token_content
    
    # Real-time filtering as tokens arrive
    if len(buffer) > 3:
        filtered_buffer = self._filter_roleplay_in_buffer(buffer)
        if filtered_buffer != buffer:
            # Pattern detected - filter it out immediately
            chunk_data["content"] = filtered_buffer
            chunk = f"data: {json.dumps(chunk_data)}"
            buffer = ""
```

**Purpose:** Prevents users from seeing roleplay expressions as they're being generated in real-time.

**Quick Patterns Filtered:**
- `*smiles warmly*`
- `*smiles*`
- `*leans in*`
- `*leans in slightly*`
- `*chuckles*`
- `*nods*`, `*winks*`, `*grins*`
- `smiles warmly ` (without asterisks)
- `eyes sparkling`

### **Layer 3: Comprehensive Post-Processing Filter**
**Location:** `/backend/intelligent_chat/services/base_chat_service.py` (lines 471-552)

**Implementation:**
Aggressive cleaning of **50+ roleplay patterns** including:

**Facial Expressions:**
- smiles, grins, chuckles, laughs, giggles, winks, nods, shakes head, tilts head

**Emotional Actions:**
- sighs, gasps, beams, blushes, tears up

**Physical Gestures:**
- waves, clears throat, pauses, leans in/forward/back, sits back, adjusts

**Eye-Related:**
- eyes sparkling, eyes bright, eyes wide, looks at you, gazes

**Combined Patterns:**
- "with a warm smile"
- "eyes sparkling with curiosity"
- "smiles and nods"

**Advanced Cleaning:**
1. Removes patterns with/without asterisks
2. Removes standalone action words at sentence starts
3. Removes any remaining single-asterisk text (preserves markdown bold `**`)
4. Cleans up excess whitespace

**Applied At:**
- ✅ End of streaming response (line 860)
- ✅ Non-streaming response (line 920)
- ✅ All stored messages

## Coverage Summary

| Component | Layer 1 (Prompt) | Layer 2 (Real-Time) | Layer 3 (Post-Process) |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| General Mode | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Health Mode | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Way of Dog Mode | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Reminder Mode | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Testing Examples

### ❌ Before Filtering:
```
*smiles warmly* Hello there! 😊 It's wonderful to hear from you again.

*leans in slightly, eyes sparkling with curiosity* I'm all ears.
What would you like to discuss today?
```

### ✅ After Filtering:
```
Hello there! 😊 It's wonderful to hear from you again.

I'm all ears. What would you like to discuss today?
```

## Why This Works

1. **Preventative (Layer 1):** Strong prompt instructions with explicit examples train the AI not to generate these patterns
2. **Reactive Real-Time (Layer 2):** Catches patterns during streaming so users never see them
3. **Defensive (Layer 3):** Final cleanup ensures nothing slips through, even unexpected patterns

**Result:** Zero tolerance for roleplay expressions across all modes! 🎯

---

## Maintenance

If new roleplay patterns emerge:

1. **Add to Layer 2** (`_filter_roleplay_in_buffer`) for real-time filtering
2. **Add to Layer 3** (`_clean_roleplay_actions`) for comprehensive cleanup
3. **Update Layer 1** prompt examples if it's a common new pattern

The system is designed to be easily extensible.
